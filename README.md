# aprs-message-check 

Poll APRS.FI for recent messages to/from callsigns you're interested in, and forward them by email (using local mail(1) client). 
Implemented because most of the IGates in my region are RX only, so I can transmit but not receive messages by RF. In my instance, this runs every ten minutes via crontab.
